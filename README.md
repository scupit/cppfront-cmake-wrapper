# CppFront CMake Wrapper

This project wraps the [cppfront repository](https://github.com/hsutter/cppfront) in a CMake build.

It also acts as a compatibility wrapper for my [gcmake-rust](https://github.com/scupit/gcmake-rust) tool,
so that cppfront can be used out of the box.

## Default Build and Install

``` sh
git clone 'git@github.com:scupit/cppfront-cmake-wrapper.git'
cmake -B build/ # ... any other CMake options such as -G 'Ninja'
cmake --build build/ --parallel
# Or run in an Administrator prompt in Windows
sudo cmake --install build/
```

### CMake Build Options

| Option | Default Value | Description |
| ------ | ------------- | ----------- |
| EMBED_CPPFRONT | `ON` | Whether to clone and build cppfront. When set to OFF, CMake will try to find an existing cppfront installation on the system using [find_package](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/find_package.html) instead. This option is really only for internal use by [gcmake-rust](https://github.com/scupit/gcmake-rust), and should be left `ON`. |
| CPPFRONT_INSTALL | `ON` when building as the main project, `OFF` otherwise | When `ON`, configures installation information so that cppfront can be installed on the system just by running `cmake --install your-build-dir/`. |
| CPPFRONT_BUILD_EXAMPLE | `ON` when building as the main project, `OFF` otherwise | When `ON`, builds the [example/ project](example/) which only uses .cpp2 files for implementation. |

### Provided Targets

These targets are always provided when embedding cppfront or by finding it using
[the provided Find module *Findcppfront.cmake*](cmake/Findcppfront.cmake)

| Target | Type | Description |
| ------ | ---- | ----------- |
| cppfront::compiler | Executable | The cppfront compiler executable (*cppfront.exe, for example*). This can be used as the *COMMAND* in calls to [add_custom_command](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/add_custom_command.html) and [add_custom_target](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/add_custom_target.html). |
| cppfront::artifacts | Interface Library | Used to pass along build information needed by files cppfront generates. This includes "include directories" (include/cpp2util.h), flags, c++ standards, etc.. **cppfront::artifacts should be PRIVATE linked to any target which is built using cpp files generated by cppfront.** [target_link_libraries](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/target_link_libraries.html) is what you want. |

## Provided Files

### EmbedCppFront

[EmbedCppFront.cmake](cmake/EmbedCppFront.cmake) contains the core script which clones and builds cppfront
as part of your project. To use, just copy the file into your project's *cmake/* directory and call

``` cmake
include( cmake/EmbedCppFront.cmake )
```

inside your toplevel CMakeLists.txt. It should work out of the box.

### Findcppfront

[Findcppfront.cmake](cmake/Findcppfront.cmake) is a
[CMake Find Module](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-developer.7.html#find-modules).
When invoked using [find_package](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/find_package.html), CMake
will look for an existing cppfront installation on your system and will define the
[provided cppfront targets](#provided-targets) if found. To use, copy the file into your
project's *cmake/* directory. In your toplevel CMakeLists.txt, add the CMake directory to your
[module search path](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_MODULE_PATH.html) using

``` cmake
list( APPEND CMAKE_MODULE_PATH "${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/cmake" )
```

Then call find_package:

``` cmake
find_package( cppfront MODULE )
# Use this one if cppfront is required.
# find_package( cppfront MODULE REQUIRED )
```

This should work out of the box.
